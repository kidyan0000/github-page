## 🧭 About Me

I am a **mechanical engineer and researcher** with a strong background in **computational mechanics**, **numerical simulation**, and **software development**.

I was part of the **International Research Training Group**, where I had the privilege of being supervised by **Prof. Dr.-Ing. Ralf Müller** at the *Technical University of Darmstadt* and **Distinguished Professor Bahram Ravani** at the *University of California, Davis*. Through this program, I earned my **doctor in Engineering**, specializing in multi-physics and simulation technologies.

During my time as a **Simulation Engineer**, I worked across several domains, including:

- ⚙️ Structural mechanics  
- 🌊 Fluid mechanics  
- 🔥 Thermal analysis  

Throughout my academic and professional career, I have focused on advancing the fields of:

- 🧮 **Numerical simulation**  
- ⚡ **Algorithm optimization**  
- 💻 **Software and tool development**  

My work bridges the gap between **theoretical mechanics** and **practical applications**, leveraging computational methods and modern AI technologies to solve complex engineering problems.
